Meeting URL response shape

Meeting URL's are currently improperly reflected in the API spec for **meeting URL's in responses**. For proper meeting URL shapes in API responses, please see [Meeting URL's](/docs/meeting-urls.md).

`meeting_url`'s that are provided as a **parameter** to the API are reflected accurately in the API spec as strings.

# Custom Metadata Filtering

[](#custom-metadata-filtering)
