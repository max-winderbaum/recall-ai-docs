Real time transcription allows you to consume transcript utterances(generated by the bot) via [Real-Time Endpoints](/docs/real-time-endpoints). The following example uses a `webhook` realtime endpoint (the same applies for `websocket`).

## ❗️

Important: Concurrency considerations

When going to production, make sure that your account with your 3rd party transcription provider is configured with high enough concurrency limit to support your anticipated load.

Certain transcription providers require that you reach out to increase your concurrency limit, and we highly recommend checking this prior to running production workloads.

# Configuration

[](#configuration)

To configure a bot for real-time transcription, your [Create Bot](/reference/bot_create) request must include:
- A `webhook` [Real-Time Endpoint](/docs/real-time-webhook-endpoints) configured with the `transcript.data` event
- A `transcript` artifact configured with the `provider` of your choice

cURL

```
curl --request POST \
     --url https://us-east-1.recall.ai/api/v1/bot/ \
     --header "Authorization: $RECALLAI_API_KEY" \
     --header "accept: application/json" \
     --header "content-type: application/json" \
     --data '
{
  "meeting_url": "https://meet.google.com/hzj-adhd-inu",
  "recording_config": {
    "transcript": {
      "provider": {
        "assembly_ai_streaming": {}
      }
    },
    "realtime_endpoints": [
      {
        "type": "webhook",
        "url": "https://my-app.com/api/webhook/recall/transcript",
        "events": ["transcript.data", "transcript.partial_data"]
      }
    ]
  }
}
'

```

*In the above example, we configure real-time transcription using Assembly AI. For a full list of supported transcription providers, see [Create Bot](/reference/bot_create).*

# Webhooks

[](#webhooks)

Once the bot is in the call and is processing audio, it will start generating a transcript in real-time and sending utterances to your real-time webhook endpoint.

For verifying incoming webhooks, please see [Real-time Webhook Endpoint Verification](/docs/real-time-webhook-endpoints#verification).

## Payload

[](#payload)

A transcription event will be sent to your real-time `webhook` endpoint whenever a new utterance is returned from the transcription provider.
- `event`: `transcript.data`
- `data.data.words`: includes the transcribed text
- `data.data.participant`: includes information about the participant(speaker) of the words

The shape of the payload is as follows:

JSON

```
{
  "event": "transcript.data",
  "data": {
    "data": {
      "words": [{
        "text": string,
        "start_timestamp": { "relative": float },
        "end_timestamp": {"relative": float } | null
      }],
      "participant": {
      	"id": number,
      	"name": string | null,
        "is_host": boolean,
        "platform": string | null,
        "extra_data": object
      }
    },
    "realtime_endpoint": {
      "id": string,
      "metadata": object,
    },
    "transcript": {
      "id": string,
      "metadata": object
    },
    "recording": {
      "id": string,
      "metadata": object
    },
    "bot": {
      "id": string,
      "metadata": object
    }
  }
}

```

# Partial results

[](#partial-results)

When using real-time transcription, the time to receive a transcription webhook can vary according to how long the utterance is. In cases of longer monologues, this delay can be quite significant and may hinder the real-time experience.

To alleviate this, you can leverage **partial transcription results** to decrease the latency of transcription events, even with longer utterances.

These are low-latency partial or intermediate results for an utterance and can be used as intermediates for the final transcript.

## Enable partial results

[](#enable-partial-results)

To receive partial results, in realtime, add `transcript.partial_data` to the realtime endpoint events.

JSON

```
{
  ...,
  "recording_config": {
    ...,
  	"realtime_endpoints": [
      {
        "type": "webhook",
        "url": "https://my-app.com/api/webhook/recall/transcript",
        "events": ["transcript.data", "transcript.partial_data"]
      }
    ]
  }
}

```

A transcription event will be sent to your real-time `webhook` endpoint whenever a new partial result is available:
- `event`: `transcript.partial_data`
- `data.data.words`: includes the partial transcribed text
- `data.data.participant`: includes information about the participant(speaker) of the words

The shape of the payload is as follows:

JSON

```
{
  "event": "transcript.partial_data",
  "data": {
    "data": {
      "words": [{
        "text": string,
        "start_timestamp": { "relative": float },
        "end_timestamp": {"relative": float } | null
      }],
      "participant": {
      	"id": number,
      	"name": string | null,
        "is_host": boolean,
        "platform": string | null,
        "extra_data": object
      }
    },
    "realtime_endpoint": {
      "id": string,
      "metadata": object,
    },
    "transcript": {
      "id": string,
      "metadata": object
    },
    "recording": {
      "id": string,
      "metadata": object
    },
    "bot": {
      "id": string,
      "metadata": object
    }
  }
}

```

## Using partial results

[](#using-partial-results)

The `event` property field on the payload indicates whether or not the block is a partial result or not.

For example, if I say "Hey, my name is John. It's really nice to meet you.", I might receive:

**A series of partial results (event = `transcript.partial_data`):**

> Ay my name
>
> Hey my name is John.
>
> Hey my name is John, it's really nice

**Then a short time after this, a more accurate final result (event = `transcript.data`):**

> Hey, my name is John. It's really nice to meet you.

This is useful for cases where you may want to use partial results immediately, but then update it with the more accurate, finalized result after receiving it.

One common pattern is to to display partial results in your UI, and then replace them with the finalized version once received.

# Full Transcript

## 📘

Full transcript

In addition to receiving individual utterances via the configured realtime endpoints, the transcript will also be available on the bot's recording through `media_shortcuts`

To access this, call the [Retrieve Bot](/reference/bot_retrieve) endpoint. Within the bot's `recordings`, there will be a `media_shortcuts` object with a `transcript.data.download_url` containing a URL to download the full transcript:

JSON

```
{
  "id": "3fa85f64-5717-4562-b3fc-2c963f66afa6",
	"recordings": [
    {
      "media_shortcuts": {
        "transcript": {
          "data": {
            "download_url": "string"
          },
          ...
        }
      }
    }
  ],
  ...
}

```

# Transcription Errors

[](#transcription-errors)

If real-time transcription fails, we recommend falling back to using [Async Transcription](/docs/async-transcription).

# Languages

## Automatic language detection

[](#automatic-language-detection)

Certain AI transcription providers support automatic language detection for real-time transcription.

The table below covers each of these, and their corresponding parameters in the [Create Bot](/reference/bot_create) `recording_config.transcript.provider` configuration.

| Provider | Create Bot transcription_options parameter | Supported Languages |
| --- | --- | --- |
| assembly_ai_async_chunked | Set language_detection to true | Docs |
| aws_transcribe_streaming | Set language_identification to true and specify a list of language_options | Docs |
| gladia_streaming | language_behaviour should be set to either:- automatic single language- automatic multiple languagesMore info | Docs |



## Why are transcription webhooks so delayed?

[](#why-are-transcription-webhooks-so-delayed)

Recall will POST any results from the configured transcription provider as they're received. When using partial results, the frequency is typically in the hundreds of ms to low seconds range but varies slightly by provider.

If you're seeing *large* delays in results, such as many seconds, or even minutes, this is likely due to the "single-threaded" nature of the transcription feed. Since transcription utterances are sequential and rely on being in a particular order, blocking a webhook request will delay any subsequent requests.

If you're running in a single-threaded environment, you should make sure that any processing of the transcription webhook happens asynchronously to prevent delaying future webhooks.
