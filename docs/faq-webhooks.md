## 1\. How are webhooks retried?

[](#1-how-are-webhooks-retried)

Bot status change webhooks are sent via Svix and follow [their retry schedule](https://docs.svix.com/retries#the-schedule):

> Each message is attempted based on the following schedule, where each period is started following the failure of the preceding attempt:
>
> -   Immediately
> -   5 seconds
> -   5 minutes
> -   30 minutes
> -   2 hours
> -   5 hours
> -   10 hours
> -   10 hours (in addition to the previous)
>
> If an endpoint is removed or disabled delivery attempts to the endpoint will be disabled as well.
>
> For example, an attempt that fails three times before eventually succeeding will be delivered roughly 35 minutes and 5 seconds following the first attempt.

> **CALLOUT**:

## ðŸ“˜

This retry schedule only applies to webhooks sent through svix, and does not include [Real-Time Webhook Endpoints](/docs/real-time-webhook-endpoints).



## 2\. Why was my endpoint automatically disabled?

[](#2-why-was-my-endpoint-automatically-disabled)

If all webhooks sent to a particular endpoint fail for 5 days, the endpoint will be automatically disabled. Endpoints can be re-enabled in the [webhooks dashboard](https://api.recall.ai/dashboard/webhooks/).

## 3\. How do I filter webhooks for a specific bot?

[](#3-how-do-i-filter-webhooks-for-a-specific-bot)

While the Webhook Message Viewer doesn't currently support filtering by specific bot statuses like "done", you can filter messages for a particular bot using the tag system. This method allows you to view all status change events for a specific bot.

Steps to Filter Messages by Bot ID:

**Open the Webhooks tab in the [Recall dashboard](https://recall.ai/login).**

**Locate the filter or tag input field:**

**Enter the tag in the following format: `bot.id-{BOT_ID}`**

*Example: `bot.id-8ef3d462-bdcd-44dc-9d5a-af244449a209`*

Apply the filter and this will display all webhook events for the specified bot.
