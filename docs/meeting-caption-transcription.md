Recall offers transcripts generated by native meeting captions for no additional charge. This transcription method may be particularly attractive for those looking for an economical solution for generating transcripts.

**Pros:**
- No additional charge
- Perfectly diarized: since the transcript is directly based on the underlying separated audio streams, you get perfect diarization out-of-the-box.

**Cons:**
- No per-word timestamps
- Can be lower quality depending on the meeting platform
- Language cannot be auto-detected

# Quickstart: Create a bot with meeting caption transcription

[](#quickstart-create-a-bot-with-meeting-caption-transcription)
- * *

## 1\. Start a meeting

[](#1-start-a-meeting)

Start [instant meeting](https://meet.google.com/) and copy the URL.

## 2\. Configure and create the bot

[](#2-configure-and-create-the-bot)

Call [Create Bot](/reference/bot_create.md) while providing the `recording_config.transcript.provider` with a`meeting_captions` object:

cURL

```
curl --request POST \
     --url https://us-east-1.recall.ai/api/v1/bot/ \
     --header "Authorization: $RECALLAI_API_KEY" \
     --header "accept: application/json" \
     --header "content-type: application/json" \
     --data '
{
  "meeting_url": "https://meet.google.com/sft-iwmv-eur",
  "recording_config": {
    "transcript": {
      "provider": {
        "meeting_captions": {}
      }
    }
  }
}
'

```

## 3\. Speak for a bit

[](#3-speak-for-a-bit)

After the bot joins the call, talk for a bit with your mic unmuted.

## 4\. Fetch the transcript

[](#4-fetch-the-transcript)

Call the [Retrieve Bot](/reference/bot_retrieve.md) endpoint using the ID of the bot:

cURL

```
curl --request GET \
     --url https://us-east-1.recall.ai/api/v1/bot/2e8ec5a4-a608-4ea0-b9d0-2a12aec3f0f0/ \
     --header "Authorization: $RECALLAI_API_KEY" \
     --header "accept: application/json"

```

In the response's `recordings`, the bot's recording will have a transcript object in its `media_shortcuts.transcript`:

JSON

```
{
  "id": "2e8ec5a4-a608-4ea0-b9d0-2a12aec3f0f0",
  "recordings": [
    {
      "id": "c9d15f08-83a4-4d83-ad1b-3e311bb0f253",
      "media_shortcuts": {
        "transcript": {
          "id": "b2c3c59f-45a4-43a8-9b0f-1bb79ba33580",
          "data": {
            "download_url": "https://us-east-1.recall.ai/api/v1/download/transcript?token=..."
          },
          "provider": {
            "meeting_captions": {}
          }
        },
        ...
      }
    }
  ],
  ...
}

```

Simply perform a GET request using the `data.download_url` to get the full transcript, which is in the following form:

JSON

```
[
  {
    "participant": { "id": 100, "name": "Darth Vader" },
    "words": [
      {
        "text": "No, I am your father.",
        "start_timestamp": { "relative": 9.730066299438477 },
        "end_timestamp": { "relative": 12.751030921936035 }
      }
    ]
  },
  {
    "participant": { "id": 200, "name": "Luke Skywalker" },
    "words": [
      {
        "text": "No, that's not true.",
        "start_timestamp": { "relative": 13.263169288635254 },
        "end_timestamp": { "relative": 16.988412857055664 }
      }
    ]
  },
  {
    "participant": { "id": 200, "name": "Luke Skywalkeri" },
    "words": [
      {
        "text": "That's impossible!",
        "start_timestamp": { "relative": 20.384620666503906 },
        "end_timestamp": { "relative": 22.707609176635742 }
      }
    ]
  }
]

```

Take it a step further: Webhooks

Since meeting captions are a method of [Real-Time Transcription](/docs/bot-real-time-transcription.md), you can also receive webhooks as the meeting transcript is generated.

# Troubleshooting

[](#troubleshooting)
- * *

## Zoom

[](#zoom)

### Meeting captions are disabled in-meeting

[](#meeting-captions-are-disabled-in-meeting)

If a bot didn't generate a when using meeting caption transcription, it's likely that the host had meeting captions disabled.

To allow participants to use meeting captions, meeting captions must be enabled. This setting persists across all Zoom meetings once it's set.

To enable meeting captions, navigate to **Host Caption Control Settings** while in a Zoom meeting.

![](https://files.readme.io/fee4d8c-CleanShot_2024-05-17_at_12.07.54.png)

Then, enable the setting called **Allow Closed Captioning for this meeting**

![](https://files.readme.io/52cf771-CleanShot_2024-05-17_at_12.09.49.png)

### Meeting captions are disabled globally

[](#meeting-captions-are-disabled-globally)

If the user doesn't see an option to enable meeting captions in their Zoom client, they likely have the setting turned off globally.

To resolve this, simply go to [Zoom settings](https://zoom.us/profile/setting?tab=meeting) and flip the toggle for **Automated captions**

## Microsoft Teams

[](#microsoft-teams)

If a meeting-caption-based transcript isn't being generated for Microsoft Teams, it's likely that the end user has closed captions disabled for their meetings.

This may also be set at the organization level, so if their setting is reflected appropriately they should check with their admin.

![Enabling Microsoft Teams Closed Captions

# Language support

[](#language-support)
- * *

> **CALLOUT**:

## 📘

Meeting platforms' meeting captions currently don't support automatic language detection, and the language typically must be specified by either the host (Zoom/Microsoft Teams), or the end participant themselves (Google Meet).

## Zoom

[](#zoom-1)

Zoom meeting captions are generated according to the language specified by the host.

![Zoom: Configuring meeting caption language
**Show Captions > Captions > Caption Language**](https://files.readme.io/be767ff-CleanShot_2024-04-08_at_13.09.05.png)

**Show Captions > Captions > Caption Language**

## Microsoft Teams

[](#microsoft-teams-1)

Microsoft Teams supports various languages for meeting captions by configuring these at the meeting-level by the host.

**Caption settings > Language**

Teams Example:

## Google Meet

[](#google-meet)

Google Meet captions are generated according to the language specified by each individual user. By default, bots default to English.

> **CALLOUT**:

## 📘

You can leverage languages other than English for meeting captions in Google Meet by:
- Setting up [Signed-In Google Meet Bots](/docs/google-meet-login-getting-started.md)
- Signing into the account you just set up
- Joining a google meet meeting while signed into that account, and setting the language to your desired language

This will persist for any of the bots meetings using this Google login.
