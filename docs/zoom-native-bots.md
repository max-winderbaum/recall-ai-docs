Zoom native bots utilize Zoom's Linux SDK to provide additional bot features.

While they can be useful depending on your use case, you should default to using web bots if possible for stability reasons.

Zoom native bots are useful if you need:
- Separate Audio/Video websocket streams per participant
- End-to-end encryption support for Zoom meetings
