Once a recording has completed, Recall will expose the most commonly used media types in the [Retrieve Recording](/reference/recording_retrieve.md) response under the `media_shortcuts` key. This is primarily aimed at getting unified access to relevant media objects in one response without having to make separate API calls for each media object.

The list of media objects included in `media_shortcuts` are
- `video_mixed`: includes the `video_mixed` media object of `mp4` format. this is the video recording generated by the bot for the meeting. [Retrieve Video Mixed](/reference/video_mixed_retrieve.md)
- `transcript`: includes the `transcript` media object (if requested) . [Retrieve Transcript](/reference/transcript_retrieve.md)
- `participant_events`: includes the `participant_events` media object. [Retrieve Participant Events](/reference/participant_events_retrieve.md)
- `meeting_metadata`: includes the `meeting_metadata` media object [Retrieve Meeting Metadata](/reference/meeting_metadata_retrieve.md)

Other media objects for e.g [Audio Mixed](/reference/audio_mixed_retrieve.md), [Retrieve Audio Separate](/reference/audio_separate_retrieve.md) and [Retrieve Video Separate](/reference/video_separate_retrieve.md) are not included in the `media_shortcuts` object and must be retrieved using dedicated endpoints and `recording_id` filter.
