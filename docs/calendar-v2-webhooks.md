The Calendar V2 API produces two types of webhooks, each scoped to a specific calendar and sent via Svix.

To configure a calendar V2 endpoint, you can follow [this setup guide](/docs/status-change-webhooks-setup-verification.md).

These webhooks are used to notify you about changes to calendars and their events, and you should use these to schedule bots and delete them according to your application logic.

# Events

[](#events)
- * *

## Calendar Update

[](#calendar-update)

This webhook is sent whenever the calendar's data changes (for instance, when `status` becomes `disconnected`).

JSON

```
{
  "event": "calendar.update",
  "data": {
    "calendar_id": string,
  }
}

```

You should re-fetch the calendar via [Retrieve Calendar](/reference/calendars_retrieve.md) to get the latest state.

Disconnects

A calendar will become disconnected when:
- You call the Delete Calendar endpoint
- The refresh token of the user gets revoked, which can happen either:
- Explicitly removing your installed app
- The token becomes invalidated (for example, due to a user changing their password)

*If your Google OAuth client is not approved yet, refresh tokens will [automatically expire after 7 days](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2#expiration).*

Note that you will not receive a `calendar.update` webhook event if you call the Delete Calendar endpoint as this action is initiated by you.

## Calendar Sync Events

[](#calendar-sync-events)

This webhook is sent whenever events on a calendar have been updated.

JSON

```
{
  "event": "calendar.sync_events",
  "data": {
    "calendar_id": string,
    "last_updated_ts": string, // iso 8601 formatted datetime
  }
}

```

You should re-fetch the calendar events for this calendar via [List Calendar Events](/reference/calendar_events_list.md). You can choose to do either a full sync or use the `last_updated_ts` field in the payload (pass as `updated_at__gte` query parameter) to do an incremental sync of events associated with the calendar on your end.

Use the `is_deleted` field on the calendar event object to know if the event has been removed from the calendar or not. (Note: Recall does not *delete* any calendar events, the consumer is expected to filter out events on basis of `is_deleted` attribute when displaying them to the end user)
