A **bot** is the fundamental entity for accessing a given meeting's data.

Bots are single-use, and are sent to meetings either ad-hoc ("on-the-fly"), or through scheduling them for a specific time.

Through a bot, you can interface with a meeting's video, audio, participants, and metadata live during a call through [websockets](/docs/real-time-audio-protocol.md) and webhooks. After the call, you can access any of the bot's media for as long as the data is [retained](/docs/data-retention.md).

Whether you want to run real-time analysis, transcribe and record meetings, or extract summaries and intelligence using AI, this can all be done through a bot.
