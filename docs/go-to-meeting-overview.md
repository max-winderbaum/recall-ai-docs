## ðŸš§

Go-To Meeting Support is currently in BETA.

Stability is not guaranteed and certain features may be missing.

# Setup

[](#setup)

> **CALLOUT**:

## âœ…

No setup required

Recall supports Go-To Meeting bots out-of-the-box, no setup or configuration needed.

# Recording Behavior

[](#recording-behavior)

**No recording permission** is needed for Go-To Meeting calls.

This means that as long as the bot is in the call, it will be able to record.

# Limitations

[](#limitations)

There are a few limitations to be aware of for Go-To Meeting bots:
- Password protected meetings are not supported
- Sending/receiving chat messages is not supported
